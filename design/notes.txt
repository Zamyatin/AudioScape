  THIS IS LOGIC FOR DELETE BUTTONS
  
	<% if @playlist %>
		<%= button_to "Delete Song", [@playlist, track], method: :delete, :class =>'button' %>
	<% else %>	
		<%= button_to 'Add', {action: 'create', object: song, :class => 'button' %>
	<%end%>
	
	
	
NOTES ON DEMO:

- TAG CURRENT LOCATION (icon with a pin)
- subtle changes on color on background of card for playing song
- make links red
- songcards need to go across entirely
- choose a specific display font
- use header tags and style them appropriately

- set logic on Playlist.show to hide the div listing available playlists until @playlists has playlists
- clean up song card: Title on top, artist below it - make "delete song" a link, not a button.
- Use a display font on on "My Playlists" (PS, change it to MY PLAYLISTS)... 
- PICK HOW WE ARE GOING TO DEMO, then OPTIMIZE FOR THAT SCENARIO!
- Consistent padding on user's landing page - including j
- Add a bottom to the body or the container to avoid 
- playlist header neesd to look like header
- get rid of turquoise coloring between song cards
- make "delete" a link in song cards
- get a MORE DEFAULT looking image for default image
- pull random coverart from albums inside the playlists to 
- design fonts for mobile 
- create playlist



BUGS: 

- no deletion on someone else's playlist
- header is forced down
- bar above player but below delete/tag buttons 


VISUAL HIERRARCHY OF PLAYLIST

- full length
- song title BOLD/BIGGER than other elements
- artist under title, smaller text
- delete song (grey if pink)
